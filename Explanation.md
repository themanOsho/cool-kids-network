# Cool Kids Network Plugin - Documentation

## 📌 Problem Statement
The **Cool Kids Network** plugin is designed to **manage user roles and authentication** in a WordPress environment. The goal is to allow users to **register, log in, and have their roles updated** based on an administrator’s actions.

### **Challenges Addressed:**
1. **Managing user roles efficiently** within WordPress.
2. **Providing an admin panel** to assign roles easily.
3. **Creating a user-friendly login and registration system**.
4. **Ensuring security** through nonce verification and sanitization.
5. **Making sure the plugin works across all themes and page builders (e.g., Elementor).**

## 🔧 **Technical Specification**

### **1️⃣ User Roles**
The plugin registers three custom user roles:
- **Cool Kid** - Basic role with limited access.
- **Cooler Kid** - Can view basic user info.
- **Coolest Kid** - Can view all users, including emails and roles.

### **2️⃣ Registration & Login**
- Registration uses the **RandomUser API** to generate fake user data.
- Login is handled via **AJAX** to prevent conflicts with themes like Elementor.
- **Nonces** are used to secure login and registration.

### **3️⃣ Admin Role Management UI**
- Admins can assign roles using a custom **WordPress Admin Page**.
- Only admins can update roles via a **secure REST API (`cool-kids/v1/update-role`)**.

### **4️⃣ REST API Implementation**
- The API allows **secure role updates**.
- API requests are **validated and checked for permissions**.
- API responds with JSON messages.

### **5️⃣ Front-End Design Improvements**
- The plugin includes **custom CSS styles** to prevent theme conflicts.
- Forms are **styled properly** and remain responsive.
- **AJAX login prevents Elementor and other themes from breaking authentication.**

### **6️⃣ Security Measures**
- **Nonce verification** prevents CSRF attacks.
- **Sanitization of user input** prevents SQL injection.
- **Escaping output** prevents XSS vulnerabilities.
- **Restricted access** to API endpoints using WordPress permissions.
